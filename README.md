This is a super simple github repo on caching of discord webhooks of specific products on a specific site. This means that your main public success webhook wouldn't get ratelimited, as it will only send a webhook for each specific product on a specific site every minute.

Usage:
If you wish to use this repo then you will need to make a `.env` file, and fill this out in the format the `.env.example` file is filled out. With the `WEBHOOK` you want to use the cache checked webhook, along with an `API_KEY` to make sure not just anyone can send webhooks via your url. Please note you may also need to change the fields and how the product and site are grabbed dependent on your webhook format etc, i did it based on my bot [Mirage Software](https://www.miragebots.io/) but any change should be easy enough to make. If you have any questions feel free to dm me on discord (Vastid#0001). Thanks!
